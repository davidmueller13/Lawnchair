# Lawnchair development roadmap

This document outlines our high-level strategic priorities. It's a living document, not a set of
unbreakable promises. For the status of individual tasks, see
our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/issues) and our
team's [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/LawnchairLauncher/projects/9/views/1).

## Vision

Lawnchair's goal is to be:

* **Simple:** Match the core Pixel Launcher experience.
* **Powerful:** Offer deep, meaningful customization.
* **Stable:** Provide a rock-solid, reliable foundation.

## Roadmap

### Recently completed

- **Shipped:** `15 Beta 1` to GitHub & Play Store.
- **Completed:** A full architectural overhaul of the Search and Permissions systems.

### Current focus

This is our active development sprint. The goal is to address key bugs and deliver a highly polished
user experience.

- UI/UX overhaul of all Settings screens to Material 3 Expressive.

### Up next

Once the UX overhaul is stable, our focus will shift to delivering highly-requested features that
enhance
customization and control.

- Proper icon swipe gestures
- Folder "cover" mode
- App drawer tabs

### The Android 16 rebase

This is the massive, foundational undertaking to migrate our codebase to the latest Android 16
(AOSP) source. Its completion will be the foundation for our **Lawnchair 16** release.

**Status:** Actively in progress, led by a core community contributor.

### Long term or blocked

Highly-requested features that are blocked by external dependencies or require significant research.

- **Widget Stacking:** A highly complex feature requiring deep architectural investigation.
- **QuickSwitch Stability:** An ongoing effort to mitigate upstream AOSP/OEM bugs.
